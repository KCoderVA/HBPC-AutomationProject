FEAT/RESTRUCTURE: Source Namespace Replacement, Forensic Baseline Preservation, Copilot Instruction Relocation, Diff Tooling & Archive Policy

SUMMARY
Replaced legacy `src/flows/...` tree with enriched `src/power-automate/...` namespace introducing standardized verbose artifacts (originalVerbose variants, exports, issues, metadata). Captured a full cryptographic baseline (hash manifest + metrics) before replacement, generated diffs, and instituted an archive ignore policy. Relocated Copilot instructions to `.github/` for native tool discovery and updated CI/workflows, README, CHANGELOG, and artifact manifest accordingly.

PRE-REPLACEMENT STATE
- Legacy path: `src/flows/HBPC_AdmitsDischarges/stages/*` with partial vs full variants.
- Tests directory contained flow artifacts now migrated to `archives/tests/`.
- Copilot guidance lived in `dev/` (not centrally discoverable by GitHub tooling).
- No automated manifest/metrics diff for source forensic comparison.

KEY ACTIONS
1. Baseline Preservation
   - Generated `archives/src-baseline-manifest-v0.3.0.jsonl` (27 entries, path/size/sha256).
   - Captured metrics `archives/src-baseline-metrics-v0.3.0.json` (files=27 bytes=124,729).
   - Authored `SRC_BASELINE_SUMMARY_v0.3.0.md` documenting taxonomy & methodology.
2. Replacement & New Metrics
   - Introduced new tree (49 files, 395,186 bytes) under `src/power-automate/...` adding exports, issues, metadata, pending stage.
   - Generated new manifest `archives/src-new-manifest-after-replacement.jsonl` & metrics `src-new-metrics-after-replacement.json`.
3. Diff Artifacts
   - Produced `SRC_DIFF_v0.3.0_to_REPLACEMENT.md` (Added=49 Removed=27 Modified=0; namespace shift prevents path continuity).
   - Produced `TESTS_DIFF_v0.3.0_to_REPLACEMENT.md` (Removed=11; tests directory absent post-replacement).
4. Copilot Guidance Relocation
   - Moved `copilot-instructions.md` to `.github/` (dev copy marked deprecated).
   - Updated artifact manifest & README table; adjusted CI consistency check.
5. Archive Policy
   - `.gitignore` modified to ignore `archives/` recursively (forensic artifacts retained locally, excluded from future commits) and added explicit `.git/` entry.
6. Documentation & Governance Updates
   - CHANGELOG Unreleased augmented with restructure, tooling, relocation, archive policy.
   - README artifact table path corrected; Copilot entry reflects authoritative location.
7. Workflow Adjustments
   - CI artifact path consistency validation updated for instruction relocation.

DELTA METRICS
- File count: +22 (27 -> 49) (+81.5%).
- Size delta: +270,457 bytes.
- Introduction of verbose JSON/HTML variants normalizing naming from `_full` to `_originalVerbose`.
- Added binary `flow_export.zip` artifacts across stages.

RISK & MITIGATION
- Namespace path rewrite: low functional risk (artifacts, not runtime code). Hash baseline retained for rollback validation.
- Tests removal: potential coverage gap; diff artifact highlights absence—plan regeneration of automated test harness.
- Archives ignore: existing tracked archives remain until explicitly untracked (`git rm --cached -r archives/` recommended if full removal desired).

FOLLOW-UP RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Implement rename heuristic script to classify semantic continuity (removed vs added pairs with similar sizes/content).
2. Regenerate a test harness under `tests/` using new verbose artifacts.
3. Integrate manifest/diff generation into CI on tag events for automatic provenance.
4. Consider compressing large verbose HTML to reduce repository bloat if growth continues.
5. Add SARIF output for expression audits to annotate PRs.

QUALITY GATES
- Documentation & workflow patches syntactically valid (YAML & JSON basic review) – PASS.
- CI path consistency updated; no obsolete dev path expectations – PASS.
- .gitignore updated without removing required tracked artifacts – PASS (archives newly ignored going forward).

NEXT STEPS
Await confirmation to stage & commit these changes, then tag next version (candidate: v0.3.1 or v0.4.0 depending on semantic scope).
