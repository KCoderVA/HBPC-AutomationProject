FEAT/GOVERNANCE: End-of-Day Repository Consolidation, Governance Framework Establishment, CI Audit Integration, Schema Scaffolding, and Documentation Expansion (Post-Reconstruction Hardening)

SUMMARY
Established a structured, governable foundation for the HBPC Admission Flow artifacts following the initial reconstruction. Added contributor and governance guidelines, CI auditing, machine-readable field schema scaffolding, architecture mapping, versioning support, and refined CHANGELOG/README narratives. Confirmed repository cleanliness after artifact relocation, ensuring no obsolete mid-body reconstruction files remain in root. This commit transitions the project from raw recovery into managed evolution phase.

REPOSITORY STATE BEFORE THIS COMMIT
- Reconstructed flow artifacts and reports organized under `docs/` and `tests/`.
- Baseline governance partially documented but lacking formal process, CI enforcement, and centralized schema.
- README missing quickstart contextualization of new governance & automation.
- CHANGELOG Unreleased section brief; lacked forward roadmap specificity.
- No CODEOWNERS, internal license notice, or architecture diagram present yet.

KEY ACTIONS PERFORMED
1. Workspace Inventory & Diff
   - Enumerated directory tree: root, `docs/`, `tests/altered/`, `tests/flowFailure/`, `tests/flowSuccess/`, `config/`, `scripts/`.
   - Verified moved artifacts: root deletions show as tracked deletions in git (legacy copies no longer needed).
   - Confirmed absence of stray duplicates; authoritative versions reside in their designated folders.
2. Governance Additions
   - Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` with branching, commit conventions (Conventional Commits), PHI handling, rollback flow.
   - Added `GOVERNANCE.md` defining roles (Engineering, Clinical, Compliance), semantic versioning, release flow, incident response, and audit artifacts.
   - Added `CODEOWNERS` to initiate structured review assignment (currently placeholder owner).
   - Added `LICENSE.txt` internal use & confidentiality notice clarifying non-public status.
3. Automation & CI
   - Introduced `.github/workflows/ci.yml` performing schema validation, README Quickstart presence check, CHANGELOG Unreleased verification, and link linting (non-blocking warnings).
   - Added `scripts/changelog-finalize.ps1` to promote Unreleased → version with optional tag creation.
4. Schema & Configuration
   - Created `config/fieldSchema.json` scaffold for machine-readable validation (fields, fallback policy, choice rules).
   - Updated README and CONTRIBUTING to reference forthcoming audit script and config-driven documentation generation.
5. Documentation Enhancements
   - Expanded README: artifact table including governance + CI + config, active roadmap, refined Status section, EOD timestamp.
   - Updated CHANGELOG Unreleased section to structured Planned list (audit script, normalization, authoritative schema enrichment, release automation, security, anonymization, test harness).
   - Enhanced `GOVERNANCE.md` with CI workflow and config artifact references, expanded incident response steps.
   - Refined `CONTRIBUTING.md` with structured CI table and audit script forward reference.
   - Added `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` Mermaid diagram mapping trigger → get item → compose → email + future extension points.
6. End-of-Day Verbose Narrative
   - Captured this full commit message describing transformation from recovery to managed state.

ARTIFACTS ADDED
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `GOVERNANCE.md`, `CODEOWNERS`, `LICENSE.txt`
- `config/fieldSchema.json` (initial schema scaffold)
- `scripts/changelog-finalize.ps1`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/END_OF_DAY_2025-11-07_VERBOSE_COMMIT_MESSAGE.txt` (this file)

UPDATED ARTIFACTS
- `README.md`: Added EOD status, governance & roadmap integration.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Detailed Unreleased roadmap.
- `GOVERNANCE.md`: Release flow expanded (audit step), artifacts table updated.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: CI expectations table; audit script forward reference.

NO LONGER PRESENT (LEGACY ROOT COPIES NOW SAFELY RELOCATED)
- Original root-level flow HTML/json artifacts (all reside properly under `tests/`).

STANDARDS INTRODUCED
- Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) aligned with structural vs content changes.
- Conventional Commits (feat, fix, docs, chore, refactor, ci, test).
- Export naming convention: `exportedSuccess_HBPCNewAdmissionEmailWithSavedForm_<UTC timestamp>.zip`.
- Fallback uniformity expected through future audit script enforcement.

RISK REDUCTIONS
- Governance clarity reduces unauthorized ad hoc modifications.
- CI validation catches missing Unreleased placeholder & Quickstart, preventing release drift.
- Central schema config enables automated detection of fallback or `/Value` misapplication.

REMAINING GAPS / NEXT TARGETS
1. Expression audit PowerShell script (validate fallback pattern, `/Value` correctness, brace balance). Target version: v0.1.2.
2. Normalize top Patient/Social/Medical sections using unified `if(empty())` fallback.
3. Authoritative schema population via parsing a representative flow run JSON export.
4. Release automation script bundling export retrieval, audit, changelog finalize, tagging.
5. SECURITY.md for formal PHI handling guidance.
6. HTML anonymization / redaction script for safe troubleshooting outside secure context.
7. Test harness verifying section presence & fallback coverage (Pester or custom). 

METRICS (TODAY'S ADDITIONS)
- New governance / automation documents: 8
- README lines added (net): ~+40 (governance + roadmap + artifact expansion)
- CI checks introduced: 4 (schema, quickstart, changelog placeholder, link lint)
- Machine-readable schema fields scaffolded: 4 (for expansion)

QUALITY GATES
- Build: N/A (documentation only) – PASS (no blocking errors)
- CI (local simulation): README, CHANGELOG, schema structure logically valid – PASS
- Lint: Minor meta-schema warning for draft2020-12 unsupported features (non-blocking) – Deferred

FOLLOW-UP RECOMMENDATIONS
- Implement audit script before adding new fields to prevent regression.
- Transition config-driven docs generation (FIELD_SCHEMA.md auto-sync). 
- Add release candidate PR checklist enforcing export artifact presence.

CLOSING STATEMENT
End-of-day state elevates project from reconstruction to governed lifecycle, establishing processes, automation entry points, and clear future milestones. Next iteration will focus on expression auditing & normalization (v0.1.2) to move from structural governance to active integrity enforcement.
