FIX: Add missing "Marital Status" & "Usual Living Arrangements" rows to HBPC Discharge HTML summary (Compose step)

Summary:
During validation of the HBPC Discharge flow (test1_Success) two social history fields were absent from the generated HTML document and email: Marital Status and Usual Living Arrangements. These dynamic rows were never inserted into the "Discharge Summary" table of the Compose (Save-HTML-Document) action after earlier template copying.

Key Changes:
- Inserted 2 <tr> rows (lines 242–249 in raw_parameters_originalVerbose.html) with standard fallback pattern: if(empty(...),'Not specified', value).
- Used same parsing logic applied to other choice fields (split/contains pattern retained for consistency with surrounding code).
- Verified presence in both the summary table and downstream rendered output (compose_outputs & final report artifact).

Impact:
Restores complete discharge demographic/social context; eliminates manual SharePoint lookup for these two fields.

Risk:
Minimal (additive only). Failure mode if regression occurs: rows render "Not specified" but do not break layout.

Validation:
Test run (test1_Success) shows populated values when source list item contains data; fallback text appears for intentionally blank test item.

Next Steps (Optional):
Normalize remaining choice field extraction to direct /Value paths; introduce automated diff watcher for Compose HTML.
