FEAT: Test5 Workspace Standardization, Header Enrichment, and Structured Stage Documentation (Post-Reconstruction Continuation)

SUMMARY
Advanced the HBPC Admission flow artifact set from test4 partial success into a more standardized and auditable test5 state. Focus today centered on: (1) systematic header/meta enrichment across HTML and JSON artifacts, (2) consolidation and clarification of stage-based prefix taxonomy (lastSuccessPriorToChange_, reportedFailure_, test4_, test5_), (3) organizing and renaming files to align with chronological remediation lifecycle, (4) establishing clearer diagnostic snapshots for each test run, and (5) preliminary effort modeling, quantitative sampling, and performance documentation groundwork for downstream reporting. No new functional logic sections were introduced beyond the previously restored mid-body blocks; effort focused on maintainability, observability, and readiness for next correctness iteration (future test6) while confirming stability of reconstructed sections from test4.

PROBLEM CONTEXT
After prior reconstruction (test4), the Compose action regained missing sections but still exhibited two mis-populating data blocks and lacked consistent artifact-level metadata. Without uniform header structure, auditing run provenance, diagnosing intermediate outputs, and articulating partial success boundaries posed friction. File naming lacked staged grouping clarity, increasing cognitive load for cross-session continuity and external stakeholder review.

OBJECTIVES (TODAY)
1. Normalize header comment blocks across all current-stage HTML/JSON artifacts (test5) to include: File Description, Purpose, Flow identifiers, Run timestamp, Outcome classification, direct flow/run URLs, and output file reference.
2. Establish authoritative stage taxonomy mapping lifecycle progression: baseline success → failure regression → partial reconstruction (test4) → enriched documentation (test5).
3. Enhance traceability by retaining prior states (without deleting baseline or failure artifacts) while isolating current active iteration.
4. Capture approximate quantitative deltas (line counts, structural variance) to enable managerial visibility into scope of changes.
5. Allocate reported 10 hours of labor across substantive improvement categories for defensible effort attribution.

AFFECTED ARTIFACT GROUPS
- test5_: rawHTMLParameters, Compose INPUTS, peekRawCode JSON (header expansion; descriptive updates; stable functional body under restored sections).
- test4_: retained for historical continuity; serves as immediate predecessor reference.
- reportedFailure_: preserved failure snapshot enabling forensic comparison (deficit ~100 lines due to missing mid-body sections).
- lastSuccessPriorToChange_: baseline success reference (October full success run) used for relative line and structure benchmarking.
- Documentation scaffolds: quick + verbose remediation reports (prior), schema reference, issue template, PR template, now supplemented by temporary summary consolidation file.

RECONSTRUCTION / STANDARDIZATION ACTIVITIES (TODAY)
1. Header Harmonization: Ensured each active test5 HTML and JSON artifact begins with multi-line descriptive block with uniform field ordering; added missing direct run links and classification of partial success nuance.
2. Stage Taxonomy Clarification: Documented progressive prefixes and their functional meaning; aligned file set into recognizable stage clusters for future automated diffing or pipeline categorization.
3. Line Count Sampling: Recorded approximate lengths: baseline success (~415–419 lines), failure (~315), reconstructed (test4/test5 inputs ~449), enriched raw parameters (~468). Interpreted net changes (restoration + enrichment) for aggregate metrics.
4. Diagnostic Augmentation: Verified presence of run outcome markers, timestamps, and unique run URLs in test5 artifacts for improved traceability in subsequent remediation when addressing remaining mis-populations.
5. Effort Modeling: Distributed 10 person-hours across header/meta enrichment, naming/organization, sampling & diff estimation, documentation refinement, test execution operations, and planning next corrective actions.
6. Temporary Consolidation: Created working summary file (__temp_test5_stageHeaderSummary.md) aggregating header excerpts and structural evolution to reduce repeated manual scanning overhead.

QUANTITATIVE METRICS (APPROXIMATE)
Lines Restored (Regression → Reconstructed): ~100 (mid-body sections absent in failure; reintroduced in prior session, validated unchanged today).
Net Enrichment Over Baseline (Styling + Headers + Commentary): +30–35 lines (post-reconstruction vs original full success state).
Header/Metadata Additions Today: 3–6 new lines per test5 artifact (descriptive fields + run link), totaling ~15–20 incremental lines across set.
Artifacts Touched (Non-binary): 8–12 (HTML, JSON, documentation, summary).
Stage Groupings Formalized: 4 (baseline, failure, test4 partial, test5 enriched).
Estimated Labor Distribution (10h total):
- Header/comment standardization: ~2.5h
- File naming / organizational taxonomy: ~2.0h
- Diff sampling & structural comparison: ~1.5h
- Documentation & schema scaffolding refinement: ~2.0h
- Test5 execution & result capture: ~1.0h
- Planning next correctness iteration (future test6 readiness): ~1.0h

RISK MITIGATION IMPROVEMENTS
1. Auditability: Uniform headers reduce ambiguity in artifact provenance.
2. Traceability: Stage taxonomy enables simplified chronological mapping and potential automated gating.
3. Maintainability: Consolidated summary file seeds future scripted diff or CI checks.
4. Separation of Concerns: Failure and baseline artifacts retained unmodified, enabling clean diff windows if further anomalies emerge.

VALIDATION STEPS (TODAY FOCUS)
- Visual header verification across test5 artifacts.
- High-level structural inspection confirming no unintended removal of reconstructed sections.
- Cross-reference of line counts vs prior sampled numbers to ensure consistency; no drift beyond expected header additions.

KNOWN REMAINING GAPS
1. Two mis-populating data blocks (details pending deeper content inspection in next iteration).
2. Lack of automated line-diff tooling or CI guard rails (manual sampling only).
3. Incomplete full-field schema population (placeholder rows exist; requires authoritative data dictionary fill).
4. Pending functional validation Test6 to confirm correction of residual field issues.

NEXT ACTION ROADMAP (POST-COMMIT)
1. Perform targeted inspection of two mis-populating blocks; isolate expression or dereferencing variances.
2. Populate FIELD_SCHEMA.md with full enumeration (internal name, type, /Value necessity, fallback policy).
3. Introduce lightweight PowerShell or script-based HTML/JSON integrity scan (balanced braces, section presence, fallback patterns).
4. Prepare Test6 run scenario matrix (null field case + full data + edge choice values).
5. Transition summary working doc into archived reference or integrate into verbose manager report appendix.

IMPACT
Enhances clarity of ongoing remediation trajectory, prepares groundwork for rapid next functional correctness iteration, and improves stakeholders' ability to evaluate work progression quantitatively and qualitatively. Sets consistent patterns for future artifact additions, reducing future onboarding and troubleshooting time.

LESSONS REINFORCED
- Early header standardization accelerates subsequent diff reasoning.
- Stage prefix taxonomy is essential when functional changes span multiple remediation phases.
- Sampling approximate quantitative deltas (even without full diff tooling) supplies sufficient managerial visibility while preserving velocity.
- Consolidation artifacts (temporary summary) reduce repeated context reacquisition overhead.

FINAL STATE (END OF TEST5 DOCUMENTATION PASS)
All active test5 artifacts carry enriched header metadata; stage taxonomy clarified; structural stability of restored sections maintained; groundwork laid for resolving remaining mis-populations and executing Test6.
