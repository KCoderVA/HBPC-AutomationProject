FEAT: Restore missing HBPC Admission HTML sections and normalize expressions

Summary:
Reinstated five lost mid-body sections (Functional Assessment, ADL, Continence, Behavioral/Cognitive, Admission Details) in the Power Automate Compose action. Standardized dynamic field access with /Value dereferencing and explicit if(empty()) fallbacks, replacing prior inconsistent coalesce() usage. Added readability aids (inputs_pretty + lint_notes) without altering runtime behavior.

Key Changes:
- Added 24 dynamic field rows with uniform fallback pattern.
- Converted choice/complex fields to outputs('Get_item')?['body/<Field>/Value'].
- Corrected malformed ADL Dressing line.
- Introduced maintainability scaffolding (inputs_pretty array, lint notes).
- Documented full remediation (FLOW_RECONSTRUCTION_REPORT.md) and created issue/PR templates.

Impact:
Restores complete admission data visibility; mitigates future silent truncation; improves maintainability and auditing capabilities.

Risk & Mitigation:
Low functional risk—only additive & normalization changes. Rollback via previous exported failure/success .zip packages or commit history.

Next Steps:
Optional: Standardize top-section null handling; implement automated expression audit; adopt source control workflow.
